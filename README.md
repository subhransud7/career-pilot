# career-pilot
Career Pilot is a local-first, multi-agent job automation system that aggregates hiring posts, analyzes them using configurable LLM agents (OpenAI / Gemini), routes tasks intelligently with fallback logic, and provides a fast review dashboard for semi-automated outreach.  It turns job hunting into a structured pipeline — not a random process.
